# 🛡️ Security Policy

## Supported Versions

HostelMate is currently in its **v1.0 (Production)** stage. As a solo-developed project, I prioritize security patches for the live deployment to ensure student and admin data remains protected.

## 🔒 Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of this platform seriously. Since this system manages student data and hall allotments, any vulnerability that could lead to unauthorized data access or privilege escalation is treated as a **Critical Priority**.

### How to report:
If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Instead:
1. **Email me directly:** noor.tay27@gmail.com
2. **Include Details:** Provide a brief description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it.

### What to expect:
* **Response Time:** I will acknowledge your report within **24-48 hours**.
* **Fix Timeline:** Depending on the severity, I aim to deploy a fix to the Netlify production environment within **72 hours**.
* **Credit:** If you find a valid bug, I’ll happily add you to a "Contributors/Security Researchers" section in the main README!
